<div class="elfjS" data-track-load="description_content"><p>You are given an integer <code>n</code>, the number of teams
    in a tournament that has strange rules:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the current number of teams is <strong>even</strong>, each team gets paired with another team. A total of
            <code>n / 2</code> matches are played, and <code>n / 2</code> teams advance to the next round.
        </li>
        <li>If the current number of teams is <strong>odd</strong>, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and
            the rest gets paired. A total of <code>(n - 1) / 2</code> matches are played, and <code>(n - 1) / 2 +
                1</code> teams advance to the next round.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Return <em>the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.</em></p>

    <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

    <pre><strong>Input:</strong> n = 7

<strong>Explanation:</strong> Details of the tournament:
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
