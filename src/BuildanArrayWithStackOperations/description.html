<div class="elfjS" data-track-load="description_content"><p>You are given an integer array <code>target</code> and an
    integer <code>n</code>.</p>

    <p>You have an empty stack with the two following operations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>"Push"</code></strong>: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li><strong><code>"Pop"</code></strong>: removes the integer on the top of the stack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You also have a stream of the integers in the range <code>[1, n]</code>.</p>

    <p>Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to
        <code>target</code>. You should follow the following rules:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of
            the stack.
        </li>
        <li>If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to <code>target</code>,
            do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Return <em>the stack operations needed to build </em><code>target</code> following the mentioned rules. If there
        are multiple valid answers, return <strong>any of them</strong>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

    <pre><strong>Input:</strong> target = [1,3], n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
</pre>

    <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

    <pre><strong>Input:</strong> target = [1,2,3], n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> ["Push","Push","Push"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].
</pre>

    <p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

    <pre><strong>Input:</strong> target = [1,2], n = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> ["Push","Push"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.
</pre>

    <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>1 &lt;= target.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
        <li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100</code></li>
        <li><code>1 &lt;= target[i] &lt;= n</code></li>
        <li><code>target</code> is strictly increasing.</li>
